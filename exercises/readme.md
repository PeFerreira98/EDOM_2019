# COGSI - EXERCISES


In this folder you should add **all** artifacts developed in exercises of the COGSI course.

### Structure of Folders

You should create a subfolder for each exercise. For instance, subfolder "exercise1" will contain all the artifacts for exercise 1 of cogsi; subfolder "exercise2" will contain all the artifacts for exercise 2 of cogsi; etc.  

**Note:** If for some reason you need to bypass these guidelines please ask for directions with your teacher and **always** state the exceptions in your commits and issues in bitbucket.
