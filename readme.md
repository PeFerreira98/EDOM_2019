# COGSI Repository

The goal of this repository is to serve as a template for the exercises and project developed during the COGSI course of the MEI Master Program, edition 2017.

** Please follow the instructions of the teachers of your course because they will always prevail over what is stated in this readme file. **
  
## Structure of Folders  

### exercises 
You should create a subfolder for each exercise inside this folder. For instance, subfolder "exercise1" will contain all the artifacts for exercise 1 of cogsi; subfolder "exercise2" will contain all the artifacts for exercise 2 of cogsi; etc.  

**Note:** If for some reason you need to bypass these guidelines please ask for directions with your teacher and **always** state the exceptions in your commits and issues in bitbucket.

### project
In this folder you should add **all** artifacts developed for the Project of COGSI.

## Issues and Commits

Each team will usually have a clone of this repository in bitbucket.

It is a good practice to create an **Issue** in bitbucket for each exercise or task that your team will be developing.

Each commit in your repository should always make a reference to the corresponding issue. For instance, in the previous example, if the issue created has an id 10, then in the commit message you should make a ref to that issue. Example: "Exercise 6 - Added network diagram for exercise, ref #10". 

You should also close the issue when the exercise or task is finished.

For each deadline/submission of your task/exercise/project you should also create a tag in the repository.
